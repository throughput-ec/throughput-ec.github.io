  <h1>DeepDive Gray Literature &amp; Annotation</h1>
    <p class="c16 subtitle" id="h.3kcc5oszpq1y">
      <span class="c20">University of Wisconsin - Geography</span></p>
      <h2>General Work</h2>
      <p>The prospective applicant will use DeepDive to mine the academic
        literature using machine learning, regular expressions (regex), and
        natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information
        relating open research databases (Neotoma Paleoecology Database,
        LinkedEarth, EarthChem) to existing publications. The postdoc will work
        with Dr. Shanan Peters and the University of Wisconsin DeepDive
        (<a href="https://geodeepdive.org">https://geodeepdive.org/</a>) team to
        generate open source (R, Python), well documented (Jupyter/RMarkdown)
        and version controlled (git) workflows that can be used as templates
        for instruction and outreach. The postdoc will work with Dr. Jack
        Williams (UWisconsin-Geography) to apply these tools to discover and
        extract information from publications in paleoecology, with a focus on
        extracting metadata and data for fossil pollen records relevant to the
        Neotoma Paleoecology Database
        (<a class="c11" href="http://neotomadb.org">http://neotomadb.org</a>) as
        a case study. The postdoc will also work with by Dr. Simon Goring
        (UWisconsin-Geography), who is overseeing the Throughput Project
        (<a href="http://throughput-ec.github.io">http://throughput-ec.github.io</a>),
        to implement methods for incorporating metadata harvested using ML
        techniques using the DeepDive platform into research databases.</p>
