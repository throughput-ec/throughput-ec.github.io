## Project Goals

Throughput is a one year pilot project, funded by the National Science Foundation ([Award #1740699 Summary](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740699&HistoricalAwards=false)).  The project is intended to address issues of data heterogeneity among mid-sized community curated data resources  (CCDRs) within the paleogeosciences.  To acomplish this task a number of tasks have been identified:

  1. A survey of existing data structures and standards, their suitability for paleogeoscience CCDRs and alignment with requirements identified by the paleogeosciences research coordination network, and their degree of adoption. This will lead to recommendations for adoption by participating resources ([EarthChem](http://www.earthchem.org/), [Flyover Country](http://fc.umn.edu/), [IODP](https://www.iodp.org/), [LacCore/CSDCO](http://lrc.geo.umn.edu/laccore/), [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth/), [Neotoma](http://neotomadb.org)) and documentation written for geoscientific audiences.

  2. Alignment of participating CCDRs to recommended standards and development of a common API that will allow data exchange among CCDRs and to third-party users.

  3. Development of an Annotation Engine, which will provide a credentialed, crowd-sourced system for scientists to flag changes to datasets, to connect datasets post hoc, to add context to legacy data, and to provide link-back notification among CCDRs when linked dataset attributes change. Annotation Engine will be embedded into existing scientific CCDR-based workflows, minimizing disruption to users.

  4. Development of GeoNoteBase to enable scientists to generate citeable, reproducible workflows that draw information from across data resources, with workflows made available through keyword searches, with full attribution. This is a pilot effort to begin some of the work Through two pilot scientific projects, THROUGHPUT will test and evaluate these new capabilities and demonstrate kinds of new scientific insights that can be gained through integration.
